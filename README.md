# Face Recognition Ultra
A Python program that recognizes known faces in the faces folder, emotion, gender and age as well as distance.

# Feature:
- Recognizes known faces in the faces folder within the directory
- Detects the person's gender
- Detects the person's age
- Detects the person's emotion
- Estimates the person's distance from the camera
- Displays all of these for every person 

# Tech Stack:
- OpenCV
- Face Recognition (Library)
- Numpy
- Threading
- DeepFace

# Installation & Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/Marvell456/Face-Recognition-Ultra.git

2. Create "faces" folder in the same directory

3. Fill the faces folder with the faces you want the program to recognize

4. Rename each image with the name of the person

3. Run the program:
   python main.py

# Future Improvements
- Work as a attendence saver
- Improve recognition accuracy
- Improve the speed of the recognition
- Add more features, such as: saving every detected 'unknown' face into a seperate window to either: supervise or add as a new 'known' face

# Why I Built This
I built this program to gain more insights on machine learning and face detection. I also tried adding more features to further refine my coding skills in using multiple libraries and models.
